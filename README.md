         "low_battery_multiplier": 3
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Google Drive Setup (Required)**

   **üì§ Complete Workflow**: Process images ‚Üí Upload to Google Drive ‚Üí Share with service account ‚Üí Configure JSON file

   Google Drive is the **only supported image source** for the photo frame:

   - **Step 1**: Process your images using the tools above to create `.bin` files
   - **Step 2**: Create a Google Service Account in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - **Step 3**: Enable the Google Drive API for your project
   - **Step 4**: Download the service account JSON key file
   - **Step 5**: **Create a Google Drive folder** and upload your processed `.bin` files to it
   - **Step 6**: **Critical**: Share your Google Drive folder with the service account email (found in the JSON key file)
   - **Step 7**: Add your Google Drive configuration to the unified `/config.json` file (see configuration section above)

   **SD Card Usage**

   The SD card serves as **configuration and caching storage only** (images are stored in Google Drive):

   - **Unified Configuration**: Single `/config.json` file with all system settings (WiFi, Google Drive, Weather, Board)
   - **Local Image Caching**: Downloaded Google Drive images are cached locally for improved performance and offline display
   - **Weather Data**: Cached weather information for offline display
   - **Temporary Files**: Download and processing temporary storage
   - **TOC System**: Two-file Table of Contents system (`toc_data.txt` and `toc_meta.txt`) for enhanced data integrity

   **Architecture Note**: Images are sourced exclusively from Google Drive and cached on SD card. The SD card is shut down after download operations complete to avoid SPI conflicts with the e-paper display. On shared SPI boards (e.g., FeatherS3), images are copied to LittleFS before display operations begin.

   **Enhanced TOC System (2025)**: The firmware now uses a robust 2-file TOC system with `toc_data.txt` containing file entries and `toc_meta.txt` containing metadata and integrity information, providing better error recovery and data validation.

5. **Binary to Image Conversion**

   The project includes a powerful Rust-based tool for converting ESP32 binary image files back to viewable formats:

   **üìã [Binary to Image Converter Documentation](docs/bin_2_image.md)** - Complete guide for the `bin2bmp` tool

   ```bash
   # Convert binary to BMP with default 800x480 size
   ./rust/bin2bmp/target/release/bin2bmp -i photo.bin -t bw
   
   # Convert 6-color binary to JPEG with custom size
   ./rust/bin2bmp/target/release/bin2bmp -i photo.bin -o output/ -s 1200x825 -t 6c -f jpeg
   
   # Validate binary file only
   ./rust/bin2bmp/target/release/bin2bmp --validate-only -i photo.bin
   ```

   **Key Features:**
   - üöÄ **Fast**: Native Rust performance with animated progress bars
   - üéØ **Smart Validation**: Helpful error messages with dimension suggestions  
   - üé® **Multiple Formats**: BMP, JPEG, PNG output support
