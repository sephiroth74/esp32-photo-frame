# ESP32 E-Paper Photo Frame

## Introduction

This project implements a battery-powered digital photo frame using an ESP32 microcontroller and e-paper display technology. The system displays images from multiple sources (Google Drive cloud storage or local SD card) achieving months of battery life through intelligent power management and the inherent low-power characteristics of e-paper displays.

The photo frame features automatic image synchronization, configurable refresh intervals, and a comprehensive configuration system that allows runtime customization without firmware recompilation. Images are processed through dedicated tools (Rust processor, Android app, or Flutter app) to optimize them for e-paper display characteristics before being uploaded to storage.

## Wiring

The project uses separate communication buses to avoid conflicts between the SD card and e-paper display. The SD card utilizes the high-speed SDIO interface while the display uses a dedicated SPI bus.

For detailed pin connections and wiring diagrams, see [Wiring Diagram Documentation](docs/wiring-diagram.md).

Key connections:
- SD Card: SDIO interface (GPIO 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17)
- E-Paper: Dedicated SPI (GPIO 35, 36, 37, 38 plus control pins)
- Potentiometer: Analog input (GPIO 18)
- Wake Button: GPIO 1 with internal pull-up

## Setup

### Development Environment

1. **Install Visual Studio Code**
   - Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Install the PlatformIO IDE extension from the marketplace

2. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sephiroth74/esp32-photo-frame.git
   cd esp32-photo-frame/platformio
   ```

3. **Configure PlatformIO**
   - Open the project in VS Code
   - PlatformIO will automatically install required packages
   - Select your board environment in `platformio.ini` (default: feathers3_unexpectedmaker)

4. **Python Virtual Environment** (Important!)
   - PlatformIO requires Python 3.10-3.13
   - Always use the project's virtual environment:
   ```bash
   cd platformio
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   # or
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```
   - This ensures compatibility with PlatformIO's build system

### Configuration

The photo frame uses a JSON configuration file (`/config.json`) on the SD card root. The configuration supports:

- **Multiple WiFi networks** - Up to 3 networks with automatic failover
- **Dual image sources** - Google Drive cloud storage or local SD card directory
- **Display settings** - Portrait/landscape mode, refresh intervals, day/night scheduling
- **Power management** - Battery-aware refresh adjustments

#### Quick Configuration Examples

**Using SD Card as image source:**
```json
{
  "wifi": [{"ssid": "YourNetwork", "password": "YourPassword"}],
  "sd_card_config": {
    "enabled": true,
    "images_directory": "/images"
  }
}
```

**Using Google Drive as image source:**
```json
{
  "wifi": [{"ssid": "YourNetwork", "password": "YourPassword"}],
  "google_drive_config": {
    "enabled": true,
    "authentication": {
      "service_account_email": "photoframe@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
      "private_key_pem": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
      "client_id": "123456789"
    },
    "drive": {
      "folder_id": "YOUR_FOLDER_ID",
      "use_insecure_tls": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Image Processing

Images must be processed into a specific binary format optimized for e-paper displays. The firmware supports only `.bin` files that match your display's resolution and color mode.

### Processing Tools

Two main tools are available for image processing:

#### 🦀 Rust Processor (Command Line)
High-performance batch processing with AI features:
```bash
cd rust/photoframe-processor
cargo build --release

# Process for black & white display
./target/release/photoframe-processor -i ~/photos -o ~/processed -t bw -s 800x480 --auto

# Process with AI person detection for 6-color display
./target/release/photoframe-processor -i ~/photos -o ~/processed -t 6c -s 800x480 --detect-people --auto
```

#### 🎨 Flutter App (Desktop GUI)
Cross-platform desktop application with graphical interface:
```bash
cd photoframe_flutter
flutter pub get
flutter run -d [windows/macos/linux]
```

📖 **[Complete Image Processing Guide →](docs/image_processing.md)**

Details on color modes, dithering algorithms, portrait pairing, and batch processing.

## Setup Guide

### Google Drive Setup (Optional)

If using Google Drive as your image source:

1. **Create Service Account** - Set up authentication in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. **Share Folder** - Grant access to the service account email
3. **Process Images** - Use the tools above to prepare your photos
4. **Configure** - Add credentials to `config.json`
