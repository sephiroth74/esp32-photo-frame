3. **Image Processing Pipeline (Required for Both Options)**

   **üîß All images must be processed before use, regardless of storage method**
   
   Both Google Drive and local SD card storage require images to be converted to the ESP32-compatible format using either:

   **üìã [Complete Image Processing Guide](docs/image_processing.md)** - Comprehensive documentation for the `auto.sh` script and all helper tools

   ```bash
   # Black & white processing (800x480 display)
   ./scripts/auto.sh -i ~/Photos -o ~/processed_images -t bw -s 800x480 --extensions jpg,png --auto

   # 6-color processing with custom fonts
   ./scripts/auto.sh -i ~/Photos -o ~/processed_images -t 6c -s 800x480 --extensions jpg,png,heic --auto \
     --font "Arial-Bold" --pointsize 32
   ```

   **Alternative: Android App (NEW)**
   
   Use the Android PhotoFrameProcessor app located in `android/PhotoFrameProcessor/` for a user-friendly GUI to process images with:
   - AI-powered person detection and smart cropping
   - Automatic EXIF date extraction and labeling
   - Portrait image pairing for landscape display
   - Real-time preview of processed results

   **Alternative: Rust Binary Converter (Recommended for Performance)**

   **üìã [Complete Rust Processor Documentation](docs/rust-photoframe-processor.md)** - Comprehensive guide with AI features, font support, and performance optimization

4. **Google Drive Configuration (Required)**

   Google Drive is the primary and only image source for the photo frame:
   
   - **First**, process your images using the tools above
   - Upload the processed `.bin` files to your Google Drive folder
   - Create a Google Service Account in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Enable the Google Drive API for your project
   - Download the service account JSON key file
   - Share your Google Drive folder with the service account email
   - Create a `google_drive_config.json` file on your SD card:

   ```json
   {
     "authentication": {
       "service_account_email": "your-service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
       "private_key_pem": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENT\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
       "client_id": "your-client-id"
     },
     "drive": {
       "folder_id": "your-google-drive-folder-id",
       "root_ca_path": "/certs/google_root_ca.pem",
       "list_page_size": 100,
       "use_insecure_tls": false
     },
     "caching": {
       "local_path": "/gdrive",
       "toc_max_age_seconds": 604800
     },
     "rate_limiting": {
       "max_requests_per_window": 100,
       "rate_limit_window_seconds": 100,
       "min_request_delay_ms": 500,
       "max_retry_attempts": 3,
       "backoff_base_delay_ms": 5000,
       "max_wait_time_ms": 30000
     }
   }
   ```

   **SD Card Usage**

   The SD card serves as initial storage for:

   - **Configuration Files**: Google Drive service account credentials (`google_drive_config.json`)
   - **Image Caching**: Downloaded images are cached locally for improved performance
   - **Weather Configuration**: Weather API settings and cached data
   - **WiFi Credentials**: Network connection information
   - **Temporary Files**: Processing and download temporary storage
   - **TOC System**: Two-file Table of Contents system (`toc_data.txt` and `toc_meta.txt`) for enhanced data integrity

   **Architecture Note**: The SD card is shut down after image operations complete to avoid SPI conflicts with the e-paper display. On shared SPI boards (e.g., FeatherS3), images are copied to LittleFS before display operations begin.

   **Enhanced TOC System (2025)**: The firmware now uses a robust 2-file TOC system with `toc_data.txt` containing file entries and `toc_meta.txt` containing metadata and integrity information, providing better error recovery and data validation.

5. **Binary to Image Conversion**

   The project includes a powerful Rust-based tool for converting ESP32 binary image files back to viewable formats:

   **üìã [Binary to Image Converter Documentation](docs/bin_2_image.md)** - Complete guide for the `bin2bmp` tool

   ```bash
   # Convert binary to BMP with default 800x480 size
   ./rust/bin2bmp/target/release/bin2bmp -i photo.bin -t bw
   
   # Convert 6-color binary to JPEG with custom size
   ./rust/bin2bmp/target/release/bin2bmp -i photo.bin -o output/ -s 1200x825 -t 6c -f jpeg
   
   # Validate binary file only
   ./rust/bin2bmp/target/release/bin2bmp --validate-only -i photo.bin
   ```

   **Key Features:**
   - üöÄ **Fast**: Native Rust performance with animated progress bars
   - üéØ **Smart Validation**: Helpful error messages with dimension suggestions  
   - üé® **Multiple Formats**: BMP, JPEG, PNG output support
   - üìÅ **Auto Naming**: Automatically generates output filenames

6. **Build and Upload**
   - Connect your ESP32 board
   - Use PlatformIO to build and upload the firmware
