# Arduino E-Paper Photo Frame

**esp32-photo-frame** is a firmware project for an ESP32-based digital photo frame. The project is designed to display images from local SD card storage or Google Drive cloud storage on an e-paper (EPD) display, with features such as battery monitoring, real-time clock (RTC) support, and multi-language localization.

   - Open the project in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [PlatformIO extension](https://platformio.org/)
   - Configure your hardware settings in `include/config.h` and `src/config.cpp` if needed

3. **Image Source Configuration**

   **Option A: Google Drive Integration (Recommended)**
   
   For cloud-based image storage and automatic synchronization:
   
   - Create a Google Service Account in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Enable the Google Drive API for your project
   - Download the service account JSON key file
   - Share your Google Drive folder with the service account email
   - Create a `google_drive_config.json` file on your SD card:

   ```json
   {
     "authentication": {
       "service_account_email": "your-service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
       "private_key_pem": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENT\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
       "client_id": "your-client-id"
     },
     "drive": {
       "folder_id": "your-google-drive-folder-id",
       "root_ca_path": "/certs/google_root_ca.pem",
       "list_page_size": 150,
       "use_insecure_tls": false
     },
     "caching": {
       "local_path": "/gdrive",
       "toc_filename": "toc.txt",
       "toc_max_age_seconds": 604800
     },
     "rate_limiting": {
       "max_requests_per_window": 100,
       "rate_limit_window_seconds": 100,
       "min_request_delay_ms": 500,
       "max_retry_attempts": 3,
       "backoff_base_delay_ms": 5000,
       "max_wait_time_ms": 30000
     }
   }
   ```

   **Option B: Local SD Card Storage**
   
   For offline image storage, use the `scripts/auto.sh` script to process images:

   ```bash
   # Black & white processing (800x480 display)
   ./scripts/auto.sh -i ~/Photos -o ~/processed_images -t bw -s 800x480 --extensions jpg,png --auto

   # 6-color processing
   ./scripts/auto.sh -i ~/Photos -o ~/processed_images -t 6c -s 800x480 --extensions jpg,png --auto
   ```

   **Auto.sh Script Features:**
   - **Smart Orientation**: Automatically handles portrait and landscape images
   - **Image Combining**: Merges two portrait images into landscape layout
   - **Format Support**: Processes jpg, png, heic, and other image formats
   - **Annotation**: Adds filename overlays with customizable fonts
   - **Batch Processing**: Handles entire directories efficiently
   - **Binary Output**: Generates both .bmp and optimized .bin files
   - **Color Modes**: Supports black & white and 6-color e-paper displays

4. **Binary to Image Conversion**

   The project includes a powerful Rust-based tool for converting ESP32 binary image files back to viewable formats:

   **üìã [Binary to Image Converter Documentation](docs/bin_2_image.md)** - Complete guide for the `bin2bmp` tool

   ```bash
   # Convert binary to BMP with default 800x480 size
   ./rust/bin2bmp/target/release/bin2bmp -i photo.bin -t bw
   
   # Convert 6-color binary to JPEG with custom size
   ./rust/bin2bmp/target/release/bin2bmp -i photo.bin -o output/ -s 1200x825 -t 6c -f jpeg
   
   # Validate binary file only
   ./rust/bin2bmp/target/release/bin2bmp --validate-only -i photo.bin
   ```

   **Key Features:**
   - üöÄ **Fast**: Native Rust performance with animated progress bars
   - üéØ **Smart Validation**: Helpful error messages with dimension suggestions  
   - üé® **Multiple Formats**: BMP, JPEG, PNG output support
   - üìÅ **Auto Naming**: Automatically generates output filenames

5. **Build and Upload**
   - Connect your ESP32 board
   - Use PlatformIO to build and upload the firmware

## ESP32-C6 Specific Considerations

### Known Issues and Workarounds

When using **ESP32-C6 boards** (such as DFRobot FireBeetle 2 ESP32-C6), you may encounter I2C/WiFi coexistence issues that can cause JSON parsing errors in Google Drive API responses. The symptoms include:

- JSON parsing errors with truncated responses at exactly 32KB
- HTTP response corruption with character sequences like `ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ`
- `ArduinoJson` errors: `IncompleteInput` or `InvalidInput`

### **Root Cause**
ESP32-C6 has hardware-level interference between I2C operations (used for RTC communication) and WiFi operations (used for Google Drive API calls). This interference corrupts incoming WiFi data.

### **Implemented Solution**
The firmware includes comprehensive workarounds that completely isolate I2C and WiFi operations:

1. **Complete I2C Shutdown**: I2C bus is completely shut down before any WiFi operations begin
2. **WiFi Operation Isolation**: All network operations (time sync + Google Drive) happen while I2C is disabled  
3. **Delayed I2C Restart**: I2C is only restarted after WiFi is completely disconnected
4. **RTC Update Management**: Time fetched during WiFi operations is stored and applied to RTC after I2C restart

### **Alternative Solution**
For new projects, consider using **ESP32-S3 boards** (like DFRobot FireBeetle 2 ESP32-S3) which don't suffer from these coexistence issues and offer additional benefits:
- Better I2C/WiFi isolation
- More memory (PSRAM support)
- Dual-core architecture
- More stable operation

### **Code Implementation**
The workarounds are implemented in:
- `platformio/src/main.cpp`: I2C shutdown before all WiFi operations
- `platformio/src/rtc_util.cpp`: Deferred RTC updates after I2C restart
- `platformio/include/rtc_util.h`: New RTC update function declarations

## Technical Specifications

For detailed technical documentation including comprehensive error handling system, system architecture, hardware specifications, and API references, see **üìã [Technical Specifications](docs/tech_specs.md)**.

## Configuration & Customization

### Security Settings

The `use_insecure_tls` setting in your Google Drive configuration controls SSL/TLS security:

- **Secure (Recommended)**: Set `"use_insecure_tls": false` and provide a valid `root_ca_path`
- **Insecure**: Set `"use_insecure_tls": true` to skip certificate validation (not recommended for production)

### Hardware Configuration

- **Board Selection**: Choose your target board in `platformio.ini` 
- **Display Type**: Configure your e-paper display type in your board's config file
- **Pin Mapping**: Adjust pin assignments in `include/config/your_board.h`

### Software Customization

- **Localization**: Add or modify language files in `include/locales/`
- **Icons**: Use scripts in `icons/` to generate new icon headers from PNG or SVG files
- **Timing**: Adjust refresh intervals and sleep timing in the configuration files
- **Battery**: Configure battery monitoring thresholds and power-saving modes
