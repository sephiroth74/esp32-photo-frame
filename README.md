- **Faster Sync Times**: 3-5x faster for very large collections (500+ files)
- **Zero Stream Parsing**: Eliminate processing overhead entirely
- **Future-Proofing**: Ready for massive collections (1000+ files)

### **Automatic Optimization**

The firmware **automatically detects PSRAM** and enables performance bonuses:

```cpp
#ifdef BOARD_HAS_PSRAM
    // Premium performance mode
    #define GOOGLE_DRIVE_JSON_DOC_SIZE 4194304           // 4MB instant processing
    #define GOOGLE_DRIVE_STREAM_PARSER_THRESHOLD 4194304  // Eliminate streaming
#else
    // Streaming architecture (still excellent performance)
    #define GOOGLE_DRIVE_JSON_DOC_SIZE 40960            // 40KB + streaming
    #define GOOGLE_DRIVE_STREAM_PARSER_THRESHOLD 32768   // Stream for large responses
#endif
```
